## Projects


### Solo Project #1
- This is my first solo project I created by combining JavaScript for functionality, and HTML/CSS for styling and layout. The project is an interactive basketball scoreboard that allows users to track scores for both the 'Home' and 'Guest' teams, by clicking on the buttons below to add points. +1 is for 1 point, +2 is for 2 points and +3 is for 3 points.

### Solo Project #2
- This is my second solo project I created using JavaScript & HTML/CSS. The project is a passenger counter application that allows users to keep track the number of people that enter a public area (such as a train station) in real time. The 'Increment' button counts the amount of people with each click. One click would be for one person. The 'Save' button saves the amount of people you have counted using the 'Increment' button.
